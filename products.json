The 58mm portafilter, commercial grade group, and commercial style steam wand offer quality tools in crafting your own coffee drinks at home. Plus, the 3-way solenoid valve will keep your used coffee pucks dry for easy discarding (a feature you don't typically find in machines of this size).</p>\n<p>We have a lot of latte drinkers here at the office, so when we started preparing drinks it was quickly decided that the Hobby's steaming capability is its most impressive feature. To see steam explode from such a small machine is something you really need to see. For more control, we worked with Bezzera to have this version of the Hobby include a commercial steam wand. Also deserving special mention is the dedicated button for the pump for manually refilling the boiler after extended steaming.</p>\n<h2>Why You Should Get It<br>\n</h2>\n<p>The compact and sleek design of the New Hobby is approximately 9.8 inches long, 8.6 inches wide and 13.7 inches tall, packing an excellent ability to brew specialty drinks into a small space. With its minimalist-friendly aesthetic, we can envision it working well in any kitchen, dorm room, office space or anywhere that easily stores this compact semi-automatic espresso machine. The steam power it packs is nothing short of incredible, so if you enjoy milk coffee drinks like lattes or cappuccinos, you'll have a blast preparing drinks.<br></p>",

To simplify the espresso brewing process, the machine uses a pressurized portafilter and includes three different filter baskets for single shot, double shot, and E.S.E. pod espresso brewing. The pressurized portafilter creates artificial pressure that assists with extraction even if the coffee isn't perfectly tamped or ground to produce a rich crema.</p>\n<p>For milk drinks, DeLonghi's Advanced Cappuccino System takes the sometimes daunting task of milk frothing by automatically injecting air directly into the milk to produce a rich, creamy foam. When you've textured your milk the way you like, simply submerge the wand to continue heating your milk to your preferred temperature.</p>\n<p>For easy cleaning and refilling, the ECP 3420's 37oz water reservoir can be removed from the top of the machine to take to the sink for rinsing or refilling. To provide additional clearance while brewing, the drip tray slides up to accommodate cups up to 5\" high.</p>\n<h3>Pressurized Portafilter With 3 Filter Baskets</h3>\n<p>If you're a first time espresso machine owner, a pressurized portafilter is a great way to take the guesswork out of brewing.

The ECP 3630 comes with three different filter baskets for single shot, double shot, and pod espresso brewing. The machine also features storage space for your filters that are not in use.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Cappuccino System</h3>\n<p>For milk drinks like cappuccinos and lattes, DeLonghi's advanced cappuccino system is a manual milk frother that manually mixes steam and milk to produce rich, creamy milk foam without having to move the steam arm. The cappuccino system will automatically inject air into your milk using an air intake hole, when you produced your preferred amount of milk foam, simply immerse the tip into your milk to continue heating without frothing.</p>\n<h3>Removable Drip Tray</h3>\n<p>Prefer a taller cup of coffee? Thanks to the easy to remove drip tray, the ECP 3420 can accommodate cups up to 5\" tall when brewing drinks like Cafe Cremas or Americanos.</p>\n<h3>Removable Water Reservoir</h3>\n<p>For easy rinsing and refilling, the 37oz (1L) water tank can be removed from the top of the machine.</p>",

For instance, the brew pressure gauge, which lets you keep an eye on pressure while you brew and gives you a sense as to the quality of your shot. To this end, ECM has made sure that the overpressure valve is easily accessible for pump pressure adjustment, hiding it beneath the cup tray.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1200 watt heating element goes to work on the 0.4 liter eco brass boiler, heating the Casa V to brewing temperature in 5-7 minutes, or steam temperature in one minute. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why You Should Get It<br></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ECM Casa V is perfect in</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a home of one or two people, where it's performance shines. This is especially so, considering the articulating commercial style steam wand, packing a considerable amount of steam power and equipped with a two-hole steam tip for velvety milk foam. The stainless steel, mirror-finished housing is a nice talking piece, and the commercial features help make an excellent shot of espresso.<br></span></p>",

    "Body (HTML)": "<h2>Gaggia Anima Prestige Overview</h2>\n<p>The Gaggia Anima Prestige is an Italian made super-automatic espresso machine with a slim and chic design and the ability to brew a cappuccino or latte macchiato at the touch of a button. Its tall spouts are perfect for long coffees or luxurious layered milk drinks and the one-touch carafe conveniently froths milk and can be stored in the fridge between uses. For multi-user households or people who enjoy extra large drinks, the large reservoir makes this machine an ideal choice.</p>\n<h2>Features and Performance</h2>\n<p>The Anima Prestige is a mere 8.8\u201d wide and 13.4\u201d high, making it most at home under tall cabinets or on a dedicated brew bar to provide clearance for the reservoir and hopper lids. Each drink is brewed with freshly ground beans via the 5 step ceramic burr grinder. You can customize your preferred drink strength with one of 5 settings between extra mild to extra strong and your preferred temperature between low, medium and high for a range of 160 - 185\u00b0 f. To guarantee perfect dosing, the Gaggia Adapting System will automatically adjust the grind cycle as it learns your coffee after several brew cycles.<br><br>For coffee drinks the Anima Prestige offers on-demand espresso and espresso lungo which can be programmed to your desired volume simply by pressing and holding the button. Pressing the button twice will cause the drink to be ground and brewed twice in a row. You can also brew using pre-ground coffee by selecting the scoop icon via the aroma strength button and filling the machine via the bypass doser.<br><br>Milk drinks are produced with one-touch thanks to the auto-frothing carafe. With the carafe locked in, the Anima Prestige can produce a cappuccino, latte macchiato, or simply frothed milk at the touch of a button. The carafe inserts into a dedicated socket on the left side of the display and can be removed and stored in the refrigerator when not in use. When the carafe is removed, Gaggia has also included a hot water spout that takes its place and also allows you to dispense hot water for americanos, tea, or hot cocoa. Milk drinks and frothed milk can be customized just like the coffee drinks to your preferred coffee and milk volume.<br><br>Thanks to its height, the Anima Prestige has a tall 60 oz water reservoir and 15 puck dreg drawer. The bean hopper holds up to 8.8oz of whole bean coffee, the frothing carafe holds 17 oz of milk, and the drip tray has a 24 oz capacity with a red float to remind you when it needs to be emptied. The brew spouts are just shy of 6\u201d tall and the blue LED screen alerts you when you need to refill the water reservoir, add more beans, clean the carafe, empty the dreg drawer, or descale.<br></p>\n<h2>Why You Should Get It</h2>\n<p>The Anima Prestige delivers effortless luxury with its tasteful steel accents and one-touch specialty milk drinks. Its carafe is a convenient solution to both milk frothing and easy cleanup while the higher capacities mean less emptying and refilling on your part. With a price tag of less than $1,000, this Anima\u2019s Prestige is more in reach than you might think.</p>\n<h2>What's in the Box</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>1x Tube of Brew Group Lubricant</li>\n<li>1x Bypass Doser Measuring Scoop / Grind Adjustment Key</li>\n<li>1x Water Hardness Test Strip<br>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "Body (HTML)": "<h2>Gaggia Anima Overview</h2>\n<p>The Gaggia Anima is a slim Italian espresso machine that is perfect for brewing full cups of coffee at the push of a button. Its tall spouts are just shy of 6\u201d and can fit a wider variety of oversized cups and travel mugs than your typical espresso machine. Thanks to the added height, the Anima also has a 60 oz reservoir and 15 puck dreg drawer meaning less refilling and less emptying.</p>\n<h2>Features and Performance</h2>\n<p>Tall and narrow, at just 8.8\u201d wide and 13.4\u201d high, the Anima\u2019s ideal home is under extra tall cabinets or on an island or dedicated espresso bar. Coffee is ground fresh for each drink by a 5 setting ceramic burr grinder and brew strength can be set in 5 steps between extra mild and extra strong. Thanks to the Gaggia Adapting System, the Anima will refine the dose based on your strength and grind setting to optimize brewing conditions for your coffee. Pre-ground coffee can also be loaded directly into the brew group via the bypass doser. And finally, you can set the Anima\u2019s brew temperature to low, medium, or high for a range of 160 - 185\u00b0 f.<br><br>On the left of the screen are the programmable buttons for one-touch espresso and espresso lungo. Each button can be programmed to your desired volume by simply pushing and holding it until the \u201cmemo\u201d icon appears on the screen. You can also brew a double by pressing the drink button twice. For specialty milk drinks and non-coffee favorites like tea or cocoa, the Anima has a dedicated button for steam and another for hot water. To froth milk, the pannarello steam wand simplifies the process by automatically aerating milk to produce rich foam with ease.<br><br>The Anima\u2019s large 60oz water reservoir and 15 puck dreg drawer are ideal for brewing frequent long coffees or for a household with multiple users. The bean hopper holds up to 8.8oz of whole bean coffee and the drip tray has a 24 oz capacity with a red float to remind you when it needs to be emptied. The brew spouts are just shy of 6\u201d tall and the blue LED screen alerts you when you need to refill the water reservoir, add more beans, empty the dreg drawer, or descale.<br></p>\n<h2>Why You Should Get It</h2>\n<p>The Anima is perfect when you have an empty mug that\u2019s waiting to be filled with coffee. It\u2019s simple and stylish, but with some added capacity that makes it less needy than other machines and your novelty mug will appreciate the novelty of the tall spouts. On top of that, the pannarello wand puts milk frothing on cruise control so you can better enjoy your home caf\u00e9.</p>\n<h2>What's in the Box</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>1x Tube of Brew Group Lubricant</li>\n<li>1x Bypass Doser Measuring Scoop / Grind Adjustment Key</li>\n<li>1x Water Hardness Test Strip<br>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "Body (HTML)": "<h3><strong>Owning the Gaggia Carezza De LUXE</strong></h3>\n<p>When we first saw the Gaggia Carezza, we forgot what year it was. The retro Italian styling is a blast from the past, belying what we\u2019ve found to be substantial brewing power for its class. A built-in temperature gauge shows a real-time readout of the boiler, which heats up rapidly. In fact, the Carezza De LUXE is ready to brew in within moments of powering on; ideal for anyone on a tight schedule. We think this machine does a lot of things right. Its automated pre-infusion function evenly soaks your coffee to maintain temperature and aid in the extraction of your coffee's flavor profile. The Carezza\u2019s specially designed Crema Perfetta double-walled pressurized portafilter is specifically designed for use with ESE pods and ground coffee, eliminating the need for a grinder. Tamping isn\u2019t necessary either, but our tests found that a light tamp can really improve your shots. <br><br>The Carezza De LUXE blends innovation with ease of use. As a hybrid machine, it brings together the control found in a semi-automatic machine, and some of the convenient elements found in a super. All-in-all, the we find the Carezza to be super easy to master and maintain. Its small footprint, and independence from grinders makes this machine a must have for beginners or baristas on a budget. For added control over your drinks, check out the Gaggia Classic; it allows for both pressurized and commercial-style brewing and steaming.</p>",

A pair of two thermostats regulate the boiler for brew and steam temperatures with LED ready lights to indicate when the machine is up to temp for your selected mode.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">For steaming milk, the commercial style steam wand takes a bit of practice, but can produce latte art quality milk foam when used with proper technique.

The Magenta Plus brings multiple updates to the much loved Gaggia Anima, improving the operating platform with full customization of four coffee drinks including a true one-touch Americano. This machine simplifies authentic espresso while offering full control over milk frothing.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p>\n<h2>Features &amp; Performance<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n</h2>\n<p>Based on the Anima series espresso machines, the Magenta Plus inherits the same slim design at under 10\u201d wide, tall spouts with 6\u201d of clearance, and the same updated brew group to dose 6.5 - 11.5g of freshly ground coffee for every drink. Improvements begin with the Magenta\u2019s full color display which features crisp icon based navigation for all drink options and audio feedback to confirm your selections. The menu of one-touch beverages will satisfy any coffee drinker with espresso (x2), espresso lungo (x2), coffee (x2), and a true americano available at the push of a button. You can also dispense hot water for tea or cocoa and most importantly steam to froth milk.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Each drink can be customized to your desired temperature, brew strength, and volume. You can also choose to brew with pre-ground coffee using the bypass doser, or make two drinks consecutively when selecting the espresso, espresso lungo, or coffee options. The hot water feature can be set to your preferred volume while the steam function will dispense steam for as long as you like. The true commercial steam wand with a 1-hole tip takes a bit of practice, but produces the best frothed milk of any super-automatic machine on the market.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Improving on more than just the brewing performance, the aesthetics of the machine have been updated in a similar fashion to Cadorna series. In addition to the full color display, attention has been paid to the spout assembly and drip tray, adding striking red accenting, a secure magnetic cover, and the subtle but genius stainless steel cup platform that can be attached to the front of the machine to prevent splashing when brewing into smaller cups.</p>\n<h2>Why You Should Get It</h2>\nIf you love authentic Italian espresso and have been searching for a machine that delivers value, quality, and flexibility, the Gaggia Magenta Plus may have been made for you. With a true commercial wand, if you have the inclination, you can produce some of the best milk available to super-automatic machines while enjoying easy espressos. Compact and classy, the Magenta Plus will have no issues sliding into your kitchen. <br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">",

    "Body (HTML)": "<h2>Gaggia Magenta Prestige Overview</h2>\n<p>Sleek and modern, the Magenta Prestige ushers in a new era of super-automatic espresso machines from Gaggia. Equipped with a convenient one-touch milk carafe, a vivid color display, and capacitive touch controls, the Magenta Prestige makes it easier than ever to craft caf\u00e9 favorites like cappuccinos, flat whites, and Americanos at home. Robust customization options allow you to further refine your drinks to your exact specifications.</p>\n<h2>Features &amp; Performance</h2>\n<p>The Gaggia Magenta Prestige offers the best of Gaggia\u2019s beverage programming. Following the example set by the Cadorna series, the Magenta allows you to fully customize each drink on the menu, setting your desired temperature, brew strength (or pre-ground coffee), and volume for all coffee drinks, as well as your desired quantity of milk when applicable. In step with modern tastes, the full drink menu offers a total 12 selections including: ristretto (x2), espresso (x2), espresso lungo (x2), coffee (x2), americano, cappuccino, caf\u00e9 au lait, caf\u00e9 cortado, frothed milk, flat white, latte macchiato, and hot water.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">To customize a drink to your tastes, simply select it from the menu and make your desired changes. All 12 of the drink options can be found on the home menu with crisp full color icons of each drink. Any time you alter the settings for a drink, you\u2019ll be prompted to save your changes at the end of the brew cycle. In order to accommodate such a wide variety of drink options, Gaggia outfitted the Magenta with a high quality steel cup riser that can be seated on the drip tray for taller cups or locked into the front of the machine to elevate your cup closer to the spouts to prevent splashing. The drip tray cover itself is a quality piece of fitted steel that secures magnetically for a more premium fit and finish.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The star of the show for the Magenta Prestige is of course the auto-frothing carafe. Locking into the front of the machine, the froths and dispenses milk automatically when preparing a milk drink. After brewing, the quick clean feature allows you to rinse the carafe before next use, and a deep clean function can be accessed from within the Magenta\u2019s menu. When not in use, you can store the carafe in the refrigerator and insert the included water spout attachment in its place. Perhaps most impressive of all, the programming logic will vary the order in which coffee or milk is dispensed for each drink, with milk first for cappuccinos and latte macchiatos, and coffee first for the caf\u00e9 au lait, cortado, and flat white.</p>\n<h2>Why You Should Get It</h2>\nThe Magenta Prestige is the perfect machine for a smaller number of users who still drink a wide variety of beverages, offering compelling choices like the true Americano which adds hot water to freshly brewed espresso at the push of a button. The one-touch carafe makes it easier than ever to produce varied and delicious and authentic milk drinks with minimal effort and cleanup. A step in a modern direction for Gaggia, the striking red trim, full color display, and capacitive buttons have the Magenta Prestige looking better than ever and certain to wow guests with its Italian design.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">",

With 5 strength selections, 3 temperatures, and 10 grinder settings, the Velasca offers more drink customization options than any other machine in its price range. Great for those who are short on space, its front loading reservoir and dreg drawer allow you to position the machine under cabinets where clearance is limited.</p>\n<h2>Features and Performance</h2>\n<p>The Velasca delivers hands-down best value for drink customization among entry level super-automatic espresso machines. Thanks to its 10 setting ceramic burr grinder, the Velasca can be dialed in more precisely to your specific coffee, with the Gaggia Adapting System optimizing dosing across the 5 brew strength settings. Further refinement in the form of 3 temperature settings make the Velasca an ideal choice for anyone looking to experiment with espresso extraction without a manual machine. You can also brew using pre-ground espresso via the bypass doser.<br><br>Your choice of espresso and espresso lungo are available on demand via dedicated brew buttons on the left side of the display. Each button can be programmed to your desired volume by pushing and holding it until \u201cmemo\u201d appears on the screen. You can also grind and brew twice in a row simply by pressing the button two times in quick succession. On the right side of the machine the dedicated buttons for steaming and hot water allow you to froth milk or dispense water via the steam wand. The pannarello design of the wand automatically aerates milk to a rich and creamy foam while the black plastic matches the black houses and is easier to clean.<br><br>Modestly sized, the Velasca has a 54 oz water reservoir, a 10.6 oz bean hopper, 4.5\u201d brew spouts, a 2 cup tray, a 10 puck dreg drawer, and an 18 oz drip tray with a water level float. The blue LED screen is clean and easy to read and the extra large buttons make interfacing with the machine a snap. Maintenance alerts keep you on top of filling the reservoir, bean hopper, emptying the dreg drawer, and descaling.<br></p>\n<h2>Why You Should Get It</h2>\n<p>The Velasca is perfect for the adventurous sort who sticks within the budget. Its wide variety of brew settings allow you to refine your coffee to your exact preferences. It\u2019s an ideal machine for the espresso purist, but also capable of brewing specialty milk drinks with ease. Final word on the Velasca is its convenient front loading reservoir and cup tray for kitchens where space is a premium.</p>\n<h2>What's in the Box</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>1x Tube of Brew Group Lubricant</li>\n<li>1x Bypass Doser Measuring Scoop / Grind Adjustment Key</li>\n<li>1x Water Hardness Test Strip<br>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "Body (HTML)": "<h2>Gaggia Velasca Prestige Overview</h2>\n<p>The Gaggia Velasca Prestige is an Italian made super-automatic espresso machine that delivers some of the best features in espresso brewing and milk frothing under $1,000. With a 10 setting ceramic burr grinder and the inclusion of optional pre-infusion, it can extract nuanced shots with ease. For milk frothing, the auto-carafe can make cappuccinos and milk foam at the push of a button and features tasteful stainless steel accenting and a handle for easier docking with the machine.</p>\n<h2>Features and Performance</h2>\n<p>Few if any super-automatic machines under $1,000 can pull a shot quite like the Velasca Prestige. Every shot is ground fresh by the burr grinder which can be set to one of 10 degrees of fineness. Then, you can refine your coffee further with 5 strength settings between extra mild to extra strong, 3 temperature settings, and the option to pre-infuse your coffee for richer extractions. To ensure perfect dosing, the Gaggia Adapting System uses a learning algorithm that updates the precision of the grinding cycle based on your selected strength and your coffee.<br><br>For strictly coffee drinks, the dedicated espresso and espresso lungo buttons will brew your beverage on demand. You can also program your desired volume for these drinks by pressing and holding the button while brewing. Pressing the buttons twice will grind and brew two times in a row for extra strong cups or for serving multiple people. To brew with pre-ground coffee, simply press the aroma strength button until the scoop icon displays on the screen and load coffee into the machine via the bypass doser.<br><br>The Velasca Prestige\u2019s auto-frothing milk carafe puts cappuccinos, milk foam, and the unique \u201cbaby cappuccino\u201d at your fingertips. Touches like stainless steel accents or magnetic locking arm elevate the experience of frothing milk with a premium look and feel. The cappuccino and milk foam are fully customizable, while the baby cappuccino is a small and quick shot of espresso with a dollop of foam similar to an espresso macchiato. A carafe quick clean button makes rising and cleaning a breeze and you can store the carafe in the refrigerator when not in use. Also included is a hot water spout that fits into the socket when the carafe is removed.<br><br>A final touch that rounds out the machine is the 8\u201d x 3\u201d cup tray that can comfortably fit around 3 espresso or 2 cappuccino cups. The Velasca Prestige has a 54 oz water reservoir, a 10.6 oz bean hopper, a 17 oz carafe, 4.5\u201d brew spouts, a 2 cup tray, a 10 puck dreg drawer, and an 18 oz drip tray with a water level float. The blue LED screen is clean and easy to read and the extra large buttons make interfacing with the machine a snap. Maintenance alerts keep you on top of filling the reservoir, bean hopper, emptying the dreg drawer, cleaning the carafe, and descaling.<br></p>\n<h2>Why You Should Get It</h2>\n<p>The Velasca Prestige delivers some of the best coffee and milk beverages in the under $1,000 category. It has some of the best brewing features for extracting delicious shots of espresso, and the milk carafe is in a class of its own among auto-frothing systems. If you\u2019re looking for great coffee and great value without compromising either, the Velasca Prestige is a strong contender.</p>\n<h2>What's in the Box</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>1x Tube of Brew Group Lubricant</li>\n<li>1x Bypass Doser Measuring Scoop / Grind Adjustment Key</li>\n<li>1x Water Hardness Test Strip<br>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The Satin finish on the boiler, the subtle curves of the handle, and the matte black powder coating on the top make this a classic and stylish way to make stovetop espresso in a stainless steel moka pot.\n<p class=\"a-spacing-base\"></p>\n<h3>Stainless Steel vs. Aluminum</h3>\n<p class=\"a-spacing-base\">Many people prefer a stainless steel coffee maker over an aluminium moka pot. This stainless steel coffee maker can be used on all types of stove tops like gas stove, induction stove, electric coil stove, propane stove, etc. Our aluminum moka pots are also high quality. However, we recommend that people not use aluminum on induction stoves because the material does not heat properly.

It is built to be heavy, and strong, and it will last you a lifetime. Replacement silicone gaskets are available for this espresso maker. However, you can also use it as a Greca coffee maker, a cuban coffee maker, a stovetop espresso machine, or an Italian style coffee percolator.</div>\n<div class=\"product-short-description\">\n<p class=\"a-spacing-base\">This type of stovetop coffee maker brews a thicker and richer coffee than a normal electric coffee percolator. This type of coffee is called Italian coffee or moka coffee or stovetop espresso. This stainless steel pot is dishwasher safe, and safe for all stovetops.</p>\n<h3 class=\"a-spacing-base\">Available in 6 cup and our largest 10 cup capacity</h3>\n<p>This stainless steel stovetop espresso coffee maker is available as a 6 cup coffee maker which makes 9.3 fl. oz or a 10 cup coffee maker which makes 16.9 oz of Italian style Moka espresso coffee. Each \u201ccup\u201d of coffee made with the Milano steel is equivalent to a single shot of espresso. Our largest Moka pot yet, the Milano steel 10 cup is perfect for entertaining to make coffee for all of your guests that will be sure to impress!</p>\n</div>",

This offers a much more convenient solution for water tank maintenance when compared to similar machines, which require that you reach over the top of the machine to pull out the water tank.

    "Title": "Rancilio Silvia M Espresso Machine",
    "Body (HTML)": "<h3>Owning the Rancilio Silvia M Espresso Machine</h3>\n<p><strong>\ufeffPlease Note: This is the most current Rancilio Silvia M, featuring an updated black brew group cover, stainless steel steam wand, and including a 58mm\u00a0professional tamper.</strong></p>\n<p>Updated for energy efficiency and more ergonomic use, the Rancilio Silvia M is the most recent entry in Rancilio's long line of home espresso machines. The Silivia M features an insulated lead-free brass boiler that reduces energy consumption by 8% when in standby mode. The main power switch has also been updated with two separate lights to indicate the status of the machine and the heating element. Famous for its status as the premier entry level machine for home espresso enthusiasts, the Silvia's 10 years of superior performance have cultivated a reputation of excellence. To ensure heat retention and lasting quality, the Silvia M features a forged marine brass group head and boiler. The large 12-ounce boiler also allows for steam capacity that is unparalleled by other machines at this size and price. An iron frame, housed by brushed stainless steel, provides durability as well as sleek, Italian style. Known for taking a bit of patience to master, Silvia owners can attest to quality of the machine and the espresso it produces. For best results while brewing, we strongly recommend pairing the Silvia M with a capable grinder such as Rancilio's own Rocky and Rocky Doserless Grinders. The Silvia M comes standard with a 7 gram coffee scoop, a tamper, and two filter baskets (single and double). The machine is backed by an extended warranty for a total of two years of warranty coverage.</p>\n<p>Some of the most crucial elements for producing high quality espresso are influenced by the Style, Size and Construction of the portafilter. Style: This portafilter is designed like a commercial machine and works in the same way. The coffee is ground fine and is tamped (pressed) firmly into place. Size: The size of the portafilter is also the same as a commercial machine. Is has a large diameter (58 mm) so that the water is distributed evenly over a wide surface area. Construction: The portafilter is made up of two parts, the handle and the filter holder. The handle is made of high quality plastic. The heavy chrome plated brass filter holder keeps the temperature stable throughout the entire brewing process, therefore producing a quality cup of espresso. This is the portion of the machine that the portafilter locks into. It is made of chrome plated marine brass which provides a superior brewing environment through maximum heat stability and component longevity. The Silvia's boiler is made of marine grade brass and has the largest volume (12 oz.) of any home machine in its class. This large volume produces the best steaming power and recycle time when brewing multiple espressos. The brass construction resists pitting and scale build up for long lasting durability.</p>\n<p>The Silvia has the same switches as their famed S20 series commercial units. There are four snap-acting rocker arm switches. The main power switch is located in the center by itself. When this is turned on the heating element is activated. A separate orange ready light will then turn on. When the light goes off the machine is at operating temperature. The top left switch operates the pump and is also known as the brew switch. Turn on to start the brewing process and off when you are done. The middle button on the left is for dispensing hot water. The bottom left switch activates the steam function. When this is turned on the boiler will heat up to steam temperature. Then turn the steam/water knob located on the side of the machine and start frothing. The Silvia now comes standard with an articulating stainless steel steam wand, allowing a greater range of motion and making it much easier to use. <span>The three-way solenoid valve is a commercial feature that relieves the water pressure off the coffee when the brew switch is turned off. This serves two functions; it dries out the coffee to prevent dripping and makes it easy to knock the coffee out of the portafilter with one knock.</span></p>",

The retro Italian styling is a blast from the past, belying what we\u2019ve found to be substantial brewing power for its class. A built-in temperature gauge shows a real-time readout of the boiler, which heats up rapidly. In fact, the Carezza De LUXE is ready to brew in within moments of powering on; ideal for anyone on a tight schedule. We think this machine does a lot of things right. Its automated pre-infusion function evenly soaks your coffee to maintain temperature and aid in the extraction of your coffee's flavor profile. The Carezza\u2019s specially designed Crema Perfetta double-walled pressurized portafilter is specifically designed for use with ESE pods and ground coffee, eliminating the need for a grinder. Tamping isn\u2019t necessary either, but our tests found that a light tamp can really improve your shots.<span>\u00a0</span><br><br>The Carezza De LUXE blends innovation with ease of use. As a hybrid machine, it brings together the control found in a semi-automatic machine, and some of the convenient elements found in a super. All-in-all, the we find the Carezza to be super easy to master and maintain. Its small footprint, and independence from grinders makes this machine a must have for beginners or baristas on a budget. For added control over your drinks, check out the Gaggia Classic; it allows for both pressurized and commercial-style brewing and steaming.</p>",
