gaggia-classic-pro,Gaggia Classic Pro Semi-Automatic Espresso Machine,"<h3><strong>Owning the Gaggia Classic Pro</strong></h3>
<p><strong>2021 UPGRADE - Stainless Steel Shower Holding Plate Now Included</strong></p>
<p>Making its debut in 2019, nearly 3 decades after the original Classic was introduced, the Gaggia Classic Pro is the successor to what is considered by many to be the best entry-level espresso machine of all time. With many subtle improvements, the now 100% Italian made Classic Pro doesn't change what it doesn't need to; it features the same rapid heating boiler, 3-way solenoid valve, and 58 mm commercial chrome-plated brass portafilter as before. Something that has changed is the new commercial style steam wand. This highly requested feature helps the Classic Pro punch above its weight class, and is capable of producing rich, velvety milk foam, perfect for latte art.</p>
<p>More nuanced updates include the change from a single control panel to distinct rocker switches for power, brew, and steam. The housing of the Classic Pro has also been refined. Indents in the frame make it easier to remove the water reservoir, while the drip tray has been streamlined with rounded edges that accentuate the contours of the machine. The decompression duct has also received a rubber grip for safer and easier removal. Internally, the brew boiler still features embedded heating elements and is ready to brew in five or so minutes. Switching to steam takes another sixty seconds, and a quick flush brings you right back to brew temperature. Brewing on the Classic Pro is even quieter than before thanks to improvements to the pump mounting that reduce noise while operating.</p>
<p>Each Classic Pro ships with a plastic tamper, a single and double shot commercial basket, and a pressurized double shot basket and two-way pin. Out of the box you're equipped to brew both pre-ground and freshly ground coffee, but your best shots will be pulled with freshly ground coffee from a burr grinder. Whether you're cutting your teeth as a new barista, or a veteran looking for a return to form, the Gaggia Classic Pro makes authentic home espresso more accessible than ever.</p>",cofshopper,,Espresso Machine (Semi/Prosumer),"3d, Alternate: Color, Category: 25th Anniversary, Category: Classic Color, Category: Gaggia, Category: My Machine, Category: Promotions, Category: Semi-Automatic, Category: Single Boiler, Category: Summer Flash, Category: The Home Barista, Feature: Feature Grid, GS: Enabled, My Machines: Enabled, NTNID: 26737, On Sale:Yes, Premium Entry Level, Promo: Free Scale: Included, Promo: GAGGIA: Eligible, Promo: Site Wide: Eligible, Sale: Cyber Monday: 2019, tax_class_4, Test: Prosumer, visible, YGroup_gaggia_classic_pro_color",VRAI,Title,Default Title,,,,,PGAEW0105ST,0,,0,deny,manual,276.25,449,VRAI,VRAI,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0569/3430/1807/products/Gaggia_Classic_Pro_-_Main.webp?v=1708613595,1,,FAUX,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,VRAI,,,VRAI,,,active
gaggia-anima-prestige-super-automatic-espresso-machine,Gaggia Anima Prestige Super-Automatic Espresso Machine,"<h2>Gaggia Anima Prestige Overview</h2>
<p>The Gaggia Anima Prestige is an Italian made super-automatic espresso machine with a slim and chic design and the ability to brew a cappuccino or latte macchiato at the touch of a button. Its tall spouts are perfect for long coffees or luxurious layered milk drinks and the one-touch carafe conveniently froths milk and can be stored in the fridge between uses. For multi-user households or people who enjoy extra large drinks, the large reservoir makes this machine an ideal choice.</p>
<h2>Features and Performance</h2>
<p>The Anima Prestige is a mere 8.8” wide and 13.4” high, making it most at home under tall cabinets or on a dedicated brew bar to provide clearance for the reservoir and hopper lids. Each drink is brewed with freshly ground beans via the 5 step ceramic burr grinder. You can customize your preferred drink strength with one of 5 settings between extra mild to extra strong and your preferred temperature between low, medium and high for a range of 160 - 185° f. To guarantee perfect dosing, the Gaggia Adapting System will automatically adjust the grind cycle as it learns your coffee after several brew cycles.<br><br>For coffee drinks the Anima Prestige offers on-demand espresso and espresso lungo which can be programmed to your desired volume simply by pressing and holding the button. Pressing the button twice will cause the drink to be ground and brewed twice in a row. You can also brew using pre-ground coffee by selecting the scoop icon via the aroma strength button and filling the machine via the bypass doser.<br><br>Milk drinks are produced with one-touch thanks to the auto-frothing carafe. With the carafe locked in, the Anima Prestige can produce a cappuccino, latte macchiato, or simply frothed milk at the touch of a button. The carafe inserts into a dedicated socket on the left side of the display and can be removed and stored in the refrigerator when not in use. When the carafe is removed, Gaggia has also included a hot water spout that takes its place and also allows you to dispense hot water for americanos, tea, or hot cocoa. Milk drinks and frothed milk can be customized just like the coffee drinks to your preferred coffee and milk volume.<br><br>Thanks to its height, the Anima Prestige has a tall 60 oz water reservoir and 15 puck dreg drawer. The bean hopper holds up to 8.8oz of whole bean coffee, the frothing carafe holds 17 oz of milk, and the drip tray has a 24 oz capacity with a red float to remind you when it needs to be emptied. The brew spouts are just shy of 6” tall and the blue LED screen alerts you when you need to refill the water reservoir, add more beans, clean the carafe, empty the dreg drawer, or descale.<br></p>
<h2>Why You Should Get It</h2>
<p>The Anima Prestige delivers effortless luxury with its tasteful steel accents and one-touch specialty milk drinks. Its carafe is a convenient solution to both milk frothing and easy cleanup while the higher capacities mean less emptying and refilling on your part.

gaggia-magenta-prestige-super-automatic-espresso-machine,Gaggia Magenta Prestige Super-Automatic Espresso Machine,"<h2>Gaggia Magenta Prestige Overview</h2>
<p>Sleek and modern, the Magenta Prestige ushers in a new era of super-automatic espresso machines from Gaggia. Equipped with a convenient one-touch milk carafe, a vivid color display, and capacitive touch controls, the Magenta Prestige makes it easier than ever to craft café favorites like cappuccinos, flat whites, and Americanos at home. Robust customization options allow you to further refine your drinks to your exact specifications.</p>
<h2>Features &amp; Performance</h2>
<p>The Gaggia Magenta Prestige offers the best of Gaggia’s beverage programming. Following the example set by the Cadorna series, the Magenta allows you to fully customize each drink on the menu, setting your desired temperature, brew strength (or pre-ground coffee), and volume for all coffee drinks, as well as your desired quantity of milk when applicable. In step with modern tastes, the full drink menu offers a total 12 selections including: ristretto (x2), espresso (x2), espresso lungo (x2), coffee (x2), americano, cappuccino, café au lait, café cortado, frothed milk, flat white, latte macchiato, and hot water.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">To customize a drink to your tastes, simply select it from the menu and make your desired changes. All 12 of the drink options can be found on the home menu with crisp full color icons of each drink. Any time you alter the settings for a drink, you’ll be prompted to save your changes at the end of the brew cycle. In order to accommodate such a wide variety of drink options, Gaggia outfitted the Magenta with a high quality steel cup riser that can be seated on the drip tray for taller cups or locked into the front of the machine to elevate your cup closer to the spouts to prevent splashing. The drip tray cover itself is a quality piece of fitted steel that secures magnetically for a more premium fit and finish.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">The star of the show for the Magenta Prestige is of course the auto-frothing carafe. Locking into the front of the machine, the froths and dispenses milk automatically when preparing a milk drink. After brewing, the quick clean feature allows you to rinse the carafe before next use, and a deep clean function can be accessed from within the Magenta’s menu. When not in use, you can store the carafe in the refrigerator and insert the included water spout attachment in its place. Perhaps most impressive of all, the programming logic will vary the order in which coffee or milk is dispensed for each drink, with milk first for cappuccinos and latte macchiatos, and coffee first for the café au lait, cortado, and flat white.</p>
<h2>Why You Should Get It</h2>
The Magenta Prestige is the perfect machine for a smaller number of users who still drink a wide variety of beverages, offering compelling choices like the true Americano which adds hot water to freshly brewed espresso at the push of a button. The one-touch carafe makes it easier than ever to produce varied and delicious and authentic milk drinks with minimal effort and cleanup. A step in a modern direction for Gaggia, the striking red trim, full color display, and capacitive buttons have the Magenta Prestige looking better than ever and certain to wow guests with its Italian design.<br data-mce-fragment=""1"">",cofshopper,,Espresso Machine (Super-Automatic),"Category: Gaggia, Category: My Machine, Category: Super-Automatic, Feature: Feature Grid, GS: Enabled, My Machines: Enabled, NTNID: 30256, On Sale:No, Promo: BFCM: Eligible, Promo: Gaggia Machines: Eligible, Promo: GAGGIA: Eligible, Promo: Site Wide: Eligible, visible",VRAI,Title,Default Title,,,,,PGAEW0097ST,0,,0,deny,manual,299.35,999,VRAI,VRAI,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0569/3430/1807/products/MagentaPrestige-Main.webp?v=1708613576,1,,FAUX,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,VRAI,,,VRAI,,,active

Something that has changed is the new commercial style steam wand. This highly requested feature helps the Classic Pro punch above its weight class, and is capable of producing rich, velvety milk foam, perfect for latte art.</p>
<p>More nuanced updates include the change from a single control panel to distinct rocker switches for power, brew, and steam. The housing of the Classic Pro has also been refined. Indents in the frame make it easier to remove the water reservoir, while the drip tray has been streamlined with rounded edges that accentuate the contours of the machine. The decompression duct has also received a rubber grip for safer and easier removal. Internally, the brew boiler still features embedded heating elements and is ready to brew in five or so minutes. Switching to steam takes another sixty seconds, and a quick flush brings you right back to brew temperature. Brewing on the Classic Pro is even quieter than before thanks to improvements to the pump mounting that reduce noise while operating.</p>
<p>Each Classic Pro ships with a plastic tamper, a single and double shot commercial basket, and a pressurized double shot basket and two-way pin. Out of the box you're equipped to brew both pre-ground and freshly ground coffee, but your best shots will be pulled with freshly ground coffee from a burr grinder.

gaggia-carezza-deluxe,Gaggia Carezza De LUXE Espresso Machine,"<h3><strong>Owning the Gaggia Carezza De LUXE</strong></h3>
<p>When we first saw the Gaggia Carezza, we forgot what year it was. The retro Italian styling is a blast from the past, belying what we’ve found to be substantial brewing power for its class. A built-in temperature gauge shows a real-time readout of the boiler, which heats up rapidly. In fact, the Carezza De LUXE is ready to brew in within moments of powering on; ideal for anyone on a tight schedule. We think this machine does a lot of things right. Its automated pre-infusion function evenly soaks your coffee to maintain temperature and aid in the extraction of your coffee's flavor profile. The Carezza’s specially designed Crema Perfetta double-walled pressurized portafilter is specifically designed for use with ESE pods and ground coffee, eliminating the need for a grinder. Tamping isn’t necessary either, but our tests found that a light tamp can really improve your shots. <br><br>The Carezza De LUXE blends innovation with ease of use. As a hybrid machine, it brings together the control found in a semi-automatic machine, and some of the convenient elements found in a super. All-in-all, the we find the Carezza to be super easy to master and maintain. Its small footprint, and independence from grinders makes this machine a must have for beginners or baristas on a budget. For added control over your drinks, check out the Gaggia Classic; it allows for both pressurized and commercial-style brewing and steaming.</p>",cofshopper,,Espresso Machine (Semi/Prosumer),"Category: Christmas Clearance, Category: Gaggia, Category: Grab and Go, Category: My Machine, Category: Semi-Automatic, Category: Single Boiler, Clearance, Feature: Feature Grid, GS: Enabled, Magento Import, Master SKU: GACARDLX, My Machines: Enabled, NTNID:25597, On Sale:No, Promo: Bonus Latte Rewards, Promo: Free Scale: Included, Promo: Gaggia Machines: Eligible, Promo: Gaggia15 BonusLR, Promo: GAGGIA: Eligible, Promo: Site Wide: Eligible, tax_class_2, Test: Prosumer, visible",VRAI,Title,Default Title,,,,,PGAEW0094ST,0,,0,deny,manual,213.85,349,VRAI,VRAI,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0569/3430/1807/products/IMG_2336.webp?v=1708613568,1,,FAUX,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,VRAI,,,VRAI,,,active
rancilio-silvia-m-espresso-machine,Rancilio Silvia M Espresso Machine,"<h3>Owning the Rancilio Silvia M Espresso Machine</h3>
<p><strong>﻿Please Note: This is the most current Rancilio Silvia M, featuring an updated black brew group cover, stainless steel steam wand, and including a 58mm professional tamper.</strong></p>
<p>Updated for energy efficiency and more ergonomic use, the Rancilio Silvia M is the most recent entry in Rancilio's long line of home espresso machines. The Silivia M features an insulated lead-free brass boiler that reduces energy consumption by 8% when in standby mode. The main power switch has also been updated with two separate lights to indicate the status of the machine and the heating element. Famous for its status as the premier entry level machine for home espresso enthusiasts, the Silvia's 10 years of superior performance have cultivated a reputation of excellence. To ensure heat retention and lasting quality, the Silvia M features a forged marine brass group head and boiler. The large 12-ounce boiler also allows for steam capacity that is unparalleled by other machines at this size and price. An iron frame, housed by brushed stainless steel, provides durability as well as sleek, Italian style. Known for taking a bit of patience to master, Silvia owners can attest to quality of the machine and the espresso it produces. For best results while brewing, we strongly recommend pairing the Silvia M with a capable grinder such as Rancilio's own Rocky and Rocky Doserless Grinders. The Silvia M comes standard with a 7 gram coffee scoop, a tamper, and two filter baskets (single and double). The machine is backed by an extended warranty for a total of two years of warranty coverage.</p>
<p>Some of the most crucial elements for producing high quality espresso are influenced by the Style, Size and Construction of the portafilter. Style: This portafilter is designed like a commercial machine and works in the same way. The coffee is ground fine and is tamped (pressed) firmly into place. Size: The size of the portafilter is also the same as a commercial machine. Is has a large diameter (58 mm) so that the water is distributed evenly over a wide surface area. Construction: The portafilter is made up of two parts, the handle and the filter holder. The handle is made of high quality plastic. The heavy chrome plated brass filter holder keeps the temperature stable throughout the entire brewing process, therefore producing a quality cup of espresso. This is the portion of the machine that the portafilter locks into. It is made of chrome plated marine brass which provides a superior brewing environment through maximum heat stability and component longevity. The Silvia's boiler is made of marine grade brass and has the largest volume (12 oz.) of any home machine in its class. This large volume produces the best steaming power and recycle time when brewing multiple espressos. The brass construction resists pitting and scale build up for long lasting durability.</p>
<p>The Silvia has the same switches as their famed S20 series commercial units. There are four snap-acting rocker arm switches. The main power switch is located in the center by itself. When this is turned on the heating element is activated. A separate orange ready light will then turn on. When the light goes off the machine is at operating temperature. The top left switch operates the pump and is also known as the brew switch. Turn on to start the brewing process and off when you are done. The middle button on the left is for dispensing hot water. The bottom left switch activates the steam function. When this is turned on the boiler will heat up to steam temperature. Then turn the steam/water knob located on the side of the machine and start frothing. The Silvia now comes standard with an articulating stainless steel steam wand, allowing a greater range of motion and making it much easier to use. <span>The three-way solenoid valve is a commercial feature that relieves the water pressure off the coffee when the brew switch is turned off. This serves two functions; it dries out the coffee to prevent dripping and makes it easy to knock the coffee out of the portafilter with one knock.</span></p>",cofshopper,,Espresso Machine (Semi/Prosumer),"Category: My Machine, Category: Rancilio, Category: Semi-Automatic, Category: Single Boiler, GS: Enabled, Magento Import, Master SKU: RASILVM, My Machines: Enabled, NTNID: 28363, OES SKU: RASILVM20, On Sale:No, Premium Entry Level, Promo: Bonus Latte Rewards, Promo: Email Exclusive: Ineligible, Promo: Free Scale: Included, Promo: Rancilio30 BonusLR, Promo: Site Wide: Ineligible, tax_class_2, visible, YGroup_rancilio_silvia",VRAI,Title,Default Title,,,,,PRAEW0091ST,0,,0,deny,manual,299.92,,VRAI,VRAI,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0569/3430/1807/products/Silvia_M_2020_-_Main.webp?v=1708613560,1,,FAUX,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,VRAI,,,VRAI,,,active

gaggia-classic-pro-espresso-machine-in-industrial-grey,Gaggia Classic Pro Espresso Machine in Industrial Grey,"<h3><strong>Owning the Gaggia Classic Pro</strong></h3>
<p>Making its debut in 2019, nearly 3 decades after the original Classic was introduced, the Gaggia Classic Pro is the successor to what is considered by many to be the best entry-level espresso machine of all time. With many subtle improvements, the now 100% Italian made Classic Pro doesn't change what it doesn't need to; it features the same rapid heating boiler, 3-way solenoid valve, and 58 mm commercial chrome-plated brass portafilter as before. Something that has changed is the new commercial style steam wand. This highly requested feature helps the Classic Pro punch above its weight class, and is capable of producing rich, velvety milk foam, perfect for latte art.</p>
<p>More nuanced updates include the change from a single control panel to distinct rocker switches for power, brew, and steam. The housing of the Classic Pro has also been refined. Indents in the frame make it easier to remove the water reservoir, while the drip tray has been streamlined with rounded edges that accentuate the contours of the machine. The decompression duct has also received a rubber grip for safer and easier removal. Internally, the brew boiler still features embedded heating elements and is ready to brew in five or so minutes. Switching to steam takes another sixty seconds, and a quick flush brings you right back to brew temperature. Brewing on the Classic Pro is even quieter than before thanks to improvements to the pump mounting that reduce noise while operating.</p>
<p>Each Classic Pro ships with a plastic tamper, a single and double shot commercial basket, and a pressurized double shot basket and two-way pin. Out of the box you're equipped to brew both pre-ground and freshly ground coffee, but your best shots will be pulled with freshly ground coffee from a burr grinder. Whether you're cutting your teeth as a new barista, or a veteran looking for a return to form, the Gaggia Classic Pro makes authentic home espresso more accessible than ever.</p>",cofshopper,,Espresso Machine (Semi/Prosumer),"Category: Classic Color, Category: Gaggia, Category: My Machine, Category: Semi-Automatic, Category: Single Boiler, Category: The Home Barista, Feature: Feature Grid, GS: Enabled, My Machines: Enabled, NTNID: 28461, On Sale:No, Premium Entry Level, Promo: Free Scale: Included, Promo: GAGGIA: Eligible, Promo: Site Wide: Eligible, tax_class_4, visible, YGroup_gaggia_classic_pro_color",VRAI,Title,Default Title,,,,,PGAEW0073ST,0,,0,deny,manual,299.35,,VRAI,VRAI,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0569/3430/1807/products/IMG_2366.webp?v=1708613521,1,,FAUX,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,VRAI,,,VRAI,,,active

<p>When we first saw the Gaggia Carezza, we forgot what year it was. The retro Italian styling is a blast from the past, belying what we’ve found to be substantial brewing power for its class. A built-in temperature gauge shows a real-time readout of the boiler, which heats up rapidly. In fact, the Carezza De LUXE is ready to brew in within moments of powering on; ideal for anyone on a tight schedule. We think this machine does a lot of things right. Its automated pre-infusion function evenly soaks your coffee to maintain temperature and aid in the extraction of your coffee's flavor profile. The Carezza’s specially designed Crema Perfetta double-walled pressurized portafilter is specifically designed for use with ESE pods and ground coffee, eliminating the need for a grinder. Tamping isn’t necessary either, but our tests found that a light tamp can really improve your shots.<span> </span><br><br>The Carezza De LUXE blends innovation with ease of use. As a hybrid machine, it brings together the control found in a semi-automatic machine, and some of the convenient elements found in a super. All-in-all, the we find the Carezza to be super easy to master and maintain. Its small footprint, and independence from grinders makes this machine a must have for beginners or baristas on a budget.

<p>The New Hobby features a lot of the industry essentials, which is great for such a small machine.

To see steam explode from such a small machine is something you really need to see. For more control, we worked with Bezzera to have this version of the Hobby include a commercial steam wand. Also deserving special mention is the dedicated button for the pump for manually refilling the boiler after extended steaming.</p>

delonghi-pump-espresso-machine-ecp-3420-in-black,DeLonghi Pump Espresso Machine ECP 3420,"<p>The DeLonghi Pump Espresso Machine, ECP 3420, is designed for new baristas with a pressurized portafilter and easy to use steam wand that makes brewing delicious espresso drinks easier than ever before.</p>
<p>The ECP 3420 brews using a 15 bar pump and a 1100 watt stainless steel boiler. To simplify the espresso brewing process, the machine uses a pressurized portafilter and includes three different filter baskets for single shot, double shot, and E.S.E. pod espresso brewing. The pressurized portafilter creates artificial pressure that assists with extraction even if the coffee isn't perfectly tamped or ground to produce a rich crema.</p>
<p>For milk drinks, DeLonghi's Advanced Cappuccino System takes the sometimes daunting task of milk frothing by automatically injecting air directly into the milk to produce a rich, creamy foam. When you've textured your milk the way you like, simply submerge the wand to continue heating your milk to your preferred temperature.</p>
<p>For easy cleaning and refilling, the ECP 3420's 37oz water reservoir can be removed from the top of the machine to take to the sink for rinsing or refilling. To provide additional clearance while brewing, the drip tray slides up to accommodate cups up to 5"" high.</p>
<h3>Pressurized Portafilter With 3 Filter Baskets</h3>
<p>If you're a first time espresso machine owner, a pressurized portafilter is a great way to take the guesswork out of brewing. These specialized portafilters assist in the extraction process by creating artificial pressure that helps to produce a crema rich shot of espresso even when using pre-ground coffee or E.S.E. pods. The ECP 3630 comes with three different filter baskets for single shot, double shot, and pod espresso brewing. The machine also features storage space for your filters that are not in use.</p>
<h3>Advanced Cappuccino System</h3>
<p>For milk drinks like cappuccinos and lattes, DeLonghi's advanced cappuccino system is a manual milk frother that manually mixes steam and milk to produce rich, creamy milk foam without having to move the steam arm. The cappuccino system will automatically inject air into your milk using an air intake hole, when you produced your preferred amount of milk foam, simply immerse the tip into your milk to continue heating without frothing.</p>
<h3>Removable Drip Tray</h3>
<p>Prefer a taller cup of coffee? Thanks to the easy to remove drip tray, the ECP 3420 can accommodate cups up to 5"" tall when brewing drinks like Cafe Cremas or Americanos.</p>
